# Django-CouchDB-Open
This Plugin simply adds a link next to a couchDB file in the Django Admin Interface. This helps to open a file very quick directly from the admin interface without setting up nginx.

Go to chrome://extensions/

Select developer mode

Click "Load unpacked extension"

Select the whole folder

That's it! Have fun! ;-)
